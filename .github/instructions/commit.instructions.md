# Commit Guidelines

**Default: Generate a single-line commit message (header only). Include body/footer only when
explicitly requested.**

## Format

```
type(scope)!: subject
```

- **type**: `feat` | `fix` | `docs` | `style` | `refactor` | `perf` | `test` | `build` | `ci` |
  `chore` | `revert`
- **scope**: _(optional)_ area affected, e.g. `parser`, `auth`
- **!**: _(optional)_ indicates a breaking change
- **subject**: imperative, lowercase, no trailing period

**Scope discipline:** scope names the affected module, package, or area — never the action being
taken. Don't use the commit's own type/verb as its scope (e.g. `commit`, `chore`, `fix`, `update`,
`misc`). If nothing more specific applies, omit the scope entirely rather than inventing one.

**Example**

```
feat(parser): add async function support
```

---

## Body (Optional)

- Leave one blank line after the header.
- Explain **what** and **why**, not **how**.

**Example**

```
feat(api): support user sessions

Add session middleware for persistent login.
Improves UX for returning users.
```

---

## Footer (Optional)

- Use for metadata, breaking changes, or issue references.
  - `BREAKING CHANGE:` short description of the change
  - `Closes/Fixes/Refs:` issue references (e.g. `Closes #123`)
- Do **not** add `Co-authored-by` trailers or any other Copilot/agent authorship attribution.

**Board issues:** when a commit advances an engineering-board issue, add a `Refs: #N` trailer (one
issue per line for several). The `git-merge` promotion script harvests these from the promoted
commit range and self-documents the promotion PRs. The harvester **preserves the keyword — it never
upgrades a `Refs` to a `Closes`.** A reference is emitted as `Closes #N` only when the commit wrote
a closing keyword (`Closes`/`Fixes`/`Resolves`), and only on the hop into the default branch (so the
issue auto-closes on release); a deliberate `Refs #N` stays `Refs #N` on every hop, including the
final one. Intermediate hops always emit `Refs #N`. So: use `Closes:`/`Fixes:`/`Resolves:` only when
that commit genuinely completes the issue; use `Refs:` for partial progress you don't want
auto-closed, and it will never be promoted to a close.

**Example**

```
fix(auth)!: reject tokens signed with the old key

BREAKING CHANGE: tokens issued before the key rotation are no longer accepted.
Closes #456
```

---

## Reverts

Use the `revert` type with the original header in quotes in the body. Include the SHA of the
reverted commit.

**Example**

```
revert: feat(api): add beta endpoints

Reverts commit 1a2b3c4.
```

---

## Release Guidance

`feat` → minor | `fix`/`perf` → patch | `BREAKING CHANGE`/`!` → major
